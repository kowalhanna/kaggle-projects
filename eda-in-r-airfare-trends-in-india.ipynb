They were collected using web scraping techniques with Python, including the Beautiful Soup and Selenium libraries. It includes data such as:\n\n- **Booking and travel dates**\n- **Airline and class**\n- **Departure/arrival times and locations**\n- **Flight duration**\n- **Number of stops**\n- **Ticket prices**\n\nThe dataset contains information on flights from the 7 largest airports in India and can be used for analyzing ticket prices, identifying optimal booking times, and studying trends in the industry.\n\n## Preparation for Analysis and Visualization","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# Load libraries\nlibrary(gridExtra)\nlibrary(grid)\nlibrary(ggplot2)\nlibrary(RColorBrewer)\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(lubridate)\nlibrary(readr)\nlibrary(dplyr)\nlibrary(tidyr)\nlibrary(skimr)\nlibrary(janitor)\nlibrary(forcats)\n\n# Read dataset\nflights <- read_csv('/kaggle/input/airfare-ml-predicting-flight-fares/Cleaned_dataset.csv')","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2024-04-29T10:37:40.328336Z","iopub.execute_input":"2024-04-29T10:37:40.330899Z","iopub.status.idle":"2024-04-29T10:37:41.455656Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### Getting Familiar with the Dataset\n\nBelow are the basic information and statistics regarding the dataset.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# Displaying the first few rows of the dataset\nhead(flights)\n\n# Checking the dimensions of the dataset\ndim(flights)\n\n# Displaying column names\nnames(flights)\n\n# Checking the number of missing values\nsum(is.na(flights))\n\n# Basic statistics\nsummary(flights)","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2024-04-29T10:37:41.458955Z","iopub.execute_input":"2024-04-29T10:37:41.460734Z","iopub.status.idle":"2024-04-29T10:37:41.879585Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### Preparing Data for Visualization\n\nThe dataset `flights` was then prepared for visualization.
